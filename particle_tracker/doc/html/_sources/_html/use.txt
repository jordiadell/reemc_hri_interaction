Pftracker can adquire the images from two kinds of sources:

* A video file

* The computer webcam

In order to get the image from a video file using default parameters:

``./bin/pftracker -v somevideo.avi``

In order to get image from the computer webcam  using defaults parameters:

``./bin/pftracker``

After executing a window with the adquired images will be displayed at very slow motion until the user select with
the mouse the region containing the tracking target. In order to do this selection mantain pressed the left button of the mouse next to the target and a rectangle will be displayed, the selection ends when the button is released.

After this the tracker will try to put a red rectangle over the desired target frame by frame :

Other options

Print help message:

``./bin/pftracker -h``

Printed messsage:

``Usage:
./bin/main [-p particlesNumber] [-v videoPath] [-sp] [-sd particle_pos_sd] [-sds scale_factor_sd] [-h]
The -sp option means show particles
The -h option prints this instructions``

With the -sp option the rectangle of each particle is drawed:

``./bin/pftracker -v video/shoot.mpg -sp``

With the -p option is posible to specify the number used particles and with sd the standard deviation of the gaussian random number
centered at zero that is added to the particle position at each frame. At more sd, more dispersed particles:

The -sds is the standard deviation of the gaussian random number centered at zero that is added to the particle scale at each frame.

The default values for this variables are:

standard deviation 15

scale standard deviation 0.1

number of particles 100
