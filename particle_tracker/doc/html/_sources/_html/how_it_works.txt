How it works
============

* Pftracker has the following execution flow:

#. Adquire image.

#.  When the user select the target, initialize particles.

#. Move particles.

#. Select best particle comparing the histogram of the target with histogram of the particle.

#. Resample particles (duplicating the first half better particles).


The histogram is normalized before comparison, the sum of all its values is equal to one.

The histogram comparison is made with the Bhattacharyya distance:

Where N is the number of histogram bins.


The movement of the particles is made in the following way:

``particle.x = particle.x + gaussianNumberCenteredAtZero(SD)``

``particle.y = particle.y + gaussianNumberCenteredAtZero(SD)``

The same procedure is made with the particle scale (the factor by which is multiplied the initial width and height selected by the user).
